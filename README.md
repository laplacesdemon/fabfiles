My Fabric scripts for deployment.

Fabric is a great way of running procedures on remote server, as well as your local machine. Yet powerful since they are merely python scripts. I find it way easier and maintanable then writing bash scripts. 

Repo is organized by different scenerios. i.e deployment for gunicorn or apache. 

These scripts asumes that you use Mac OSX as your development environment and a debian based linux distro (i.e. ubuntu) as your server environment.
